# Tipalti IP Whitelist Fix

## 🎯 Problem Found: InvalidPayerIpAddress

Your Tipalti system is working perfectly, but the IP address is blocked for security.

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ **Credentials**: Valid (Uplify + Production)
- ✅ **API Connection**: Working
- ✅ **Payees**: 3,857 active payees exist
- ❌ **IP Access**: Blocked (InvalidPayerIpAddress)

## 🔧 Solution Options

### Option 1: Add IP to Whitelist (Recommended)
1. Go to **Tipalti Dashboard** → **Settings** → **API Configuration**
2. Find **"IP Whitelist"** or **"Allowed IP Addresses"**
3. Add your current IP address: `[YOUR_IP_WILL_BE_SHOWN]`
4. Save settings
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
6. Run backup again

### Option 2: Contact Tipalti Support
- Email: support@tipalti.com
- Subject: "Add IP address to API whitelist"
- Include: Payer name "Uplify" + IP address

### Option 3: VPN/Different Location
- Use VPN to change IP
- Run from office/different network
- Check if that IP is already whitelisted

## 🧪 Test After Fix

```bash
# Run this to test:
python test_real_payees.py

# If working, run full backup:
python backup_production_final.py
```

## 🎉 Expected Result After Fix

With IP whitelisted, you should see:
```
